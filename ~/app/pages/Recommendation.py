st.header("KEY INSIGHTS")

# School Type Distribution
st.subheader("School Type Distribution")
st.markdown("""
- Most students who responded were from private schools (17), followed by public schools (9), with only 1 student attending a "Not public but not private" school. 
- High private school participation may lead to a stronger focus on exam readiness within private institutions.
""")

# Exam Readiness
st.subheader("Exam Readiness")
st.markdown("""
- Private school students appear more confident, with over 56% reporting they are "Very Confident."
- Public school students show a higher proportion of students who are "Not Confident" (22.22%) and "Somewhat Confident" (22.22%).
- This suggests a gap in exam preparation or support between public and private institutions.
""")

# Academic Challenges
st.subheader("Academic Challenges")
st.markdown("""
- The key challenges students face include:
  1. A large syllabus to cover.
  2. Difficulty understanding teachers.
  3. Lack of adjusted teaching methods.
- These highlight the need for more effective teaching strategies and syllabus management, especially regarding the volume of content.
""")

# Technical Issues
st.subheader("Technical Issues")
st.markdown("""
- A significant portion of students (14) report never experiencing technical issues.
- However, 10 students face occasional issues, and 3 report frequent or very frequent technical challenges.
- This suggests that while technical support is sufficient for some, there is a sizable group that still faces disruptions in their learning process due to technical barriers.
""")

# After School and Family Support
st.subheader("After School and Family Support")
st.markdown("""
- Most students receive after-school support "A few times a week" (11), with some receiving it every day (6).
- A smaller number of students (2) rarely or never receive after-school support, indicating potential gaps in additional academic assistance.

# Recommendations section
st.header("RECOMMENDATIONS")

# Addressing Academic Challenges
st.subheader("Addressing Academic Challenges")
st.markdown("""
- **Curriculum Adjustments**: Institutions, particularly public schools, should focus on breaking down large syllabuses into manageable portions, possibly through a modular approach that allows students to focus on smaller, digestible content units at a time.
- **Teacher Training**: Teachers should be equipped with strategies for differentiated instruction to cater to students who find it difficult to understand lessons. Ongoing professional development in pedagogical techniques is critical for improving comprehension.
- **Supplemental Learning Resources**: Schools could introduce additional learning aids such as video tutorials, interactive online resources, or peer tutoring programs to address comprehension issues.
""")

# Strengthening Exam Confidence in Public Schools
st.subheader("Strengthening Exam Confidence in Public Schools")
st.markdown("""
- **Extra Academic Support Programs**: Public schools should consider organizing more intensive after-school programs, weekend classes, or exam preparatory workshops to build student confidence.
- **Student Mentorship Programs**: Introducing peer mentorship, where more confident students (from both public and private schools) mentor those who feel less prepared, could help improve readiness across all school types.
""")

# Improving Technical Support
st.subheader("Improving Technical Support")
st.markdown("""
- **Ensure Consistent Access to Technology**: For students who occasionally or frequently experience technical issues, schools and governments should ensure stable access to digital learning tools and provide ongoing technical support.
- **Equipment Provision and Maintenance**: Schools could benefit from grants or partnerships to provide proper technological infrastructure, such as functioning computers, internet access, and student IT support.
""")

# Parental Involvement Programs
st.subheader("Parental Involvement Programs")
st.markdown("""
- Schools should work with parents, particularly in urban areas, to increase family engagement in students' educational activities.
- Workshops for parents on supporting their childrenâ€™s education at home would be beneficial.
""")

# Holistic Exam Preparation
st.subheader("Holistic Exam Preparation")
st.markdown("""
- **Exam Simulation Programs**: Schools could simulate exam environments more frequently to prepare students for the exam day. This practice can alleviate anxiety and improve performance.
- **Mindfulness and Stress Management**: Implement programs focusing on mental well-being and stress management techniques (e.g., meditation or counseling) to help students cope with exam pressure.
""")

# Data-Driven Decisions for Improvement
st.subheader("Data-Driven Decisions for Improvement")
st.markdown("""
- School administrators should continuously use this kind of data analysis to identify gaps and monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time.
- Regular surveys and feedback loops from students will help fine-tune exam readiness strategies.
