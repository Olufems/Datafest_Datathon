# Challenges Faced by Students in WAEC and JAMB Exams in Africa

### Data Hackathon Project

This repository contains the resources and analysis from the data hackathon project focused on identifying and addressing the challenges faced by students in WAEC and JAMB exams across Africa. 

## Background

WAEC (West African Examinations Council) and JAMB (Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board) are critical examinations for students in West Africa, particularly Nigeria, as they determine access to secondary and tertiary education. Despite their importance, students face several challenges when preparing for and taking these exams, ranging from socioeconomic barriers to educational gaps.

This data hackathon aims to explore these challenges using data-driven insights, providing solutions and recommendations to improve the exam processes and outcomes for students.

## Objectives

- **Identify Key Challenges**: Leverage data to uncover the major issues students face in WAEC and JAMB exams, such as access to study materials, financial constraints, and poor infrastructure.
  
- **Analyze Patterns and Trends**: Use historical and current data to analyze trends in exam performances, demographic factors, and regional disparities.
  
- **Provide Solutions**: Develop actionable recommendations that can improve the success rates and experiences of students taking these exams.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection
- **WAEC and JAMB Data**: Data related to students’ performance, enrollment, and access to resources will be collected from public datasets, academic publications, and surveys.
- **Socioeconomic Data**: Additional data on students’ backgrounds, schools, and regions will be gathered to provide context for the challenges they face.

### 2. Data Processing & Cleaning
- Datasets will be cleaned and prepared for analysis, ensuring that missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies are handled appropriately.

### 3. Analysis & Visualization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize key insights using tools like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore trends in exam outcomes, student performance, and factors affecting success rates.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests and machine learning models to correlate different factors with exam performance, identifying the strongest predictors of success or failure.

### 4. Recommendations
- Based on insights from the data, practical recommendations will be proposed to address the challenges uncovered. This could include educational policy suggestions, resource allocation, or support programs for students.

### 5. Conclusion
- Summarize key findings and provide a roadmap for how educational stakeholders can apply the solutions derived from the project.
